          When you build a front-end application, you spend most of the time
          executing ordinary tasks. You create and validate forms, fetch data,
          show errors and confirmation messages, among other not really exciting
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those ordinary tasks, which very fastly become tedious tasks, sadly
          take too much time. And spending too much time on something that is
          not engaging does not result in delightful outputs. The hard truth
          is, while cars are going driverless, we programmers still forget to
          focus on the required field that is preventing the user from
          submitting a form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever imagined if form controls had an attribute called
          validations that could validate themselves automatically on form
          submit? If success message was just one more attribute accepted by
          the form tag? Have you ever wondered not having to worry about
          showing or hiding a loader because the form tag itself is smart
          enough to take care of this? This is what a glorious library does
          for you.

          Taslonic is glorious not because itâ€™s reinventing how selects work
          or because it makes your interface fancy. But because it takes away
          the trivial work, allowing you to invest most of your time in
          chasing exceptional results.
