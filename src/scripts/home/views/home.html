            When building a front-end application, ordinary tasks may 
            take up much of your time. Creating and validating forms, 
            fetching data, and handling error and success messages aren’t 
            exciting activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those ordinary tasks become tedious labor very quickly. 
            They take quite some time to implement. And having to invest 
            a significant share of time on joyless jobs is unlikely to 
            lead to surprising returns. The truth is, whereas cars are 
            going driverless, front-end developers still forget to focus 
            on a required field that prevents someone from submitting 
            a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever imagined what if form controls had an attribute 
            called 'validations' that could validate themselves automatically 
            on form submission? What if a success message was just one 
            more attribute accepted by the form tag? Have you ever wished 
            forms were smart enough to control the visibility of a loader? 
            This is what a graceful library does for you.

            Taslonic is graceful not because it reinvents how a select works, 
            nor because it will make your interface fashionable, but 
            because it vanishes unworthy tasks, freeing you to invest most 
            of your time in chasing delightful outcomes.
